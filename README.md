Solution working on HTML5 and Javascript, to read and display a .CSV file (comma or semicolon delimited), with a contact or phonebook.
The .CSV contents are displayed in a table, with the columns title from the .CSV being used. You can search for text in the table.
It also allows the user to click on a number and dial it, or to click in an e-mail address and open the default e-mail application to send an e-mail. 
To use it in your cell phone, simply copy the contatos_offline.html file to the Documents folder of your phone, and also a .CSV file that can be extracted from an Excell Spreadsheet, or even exported from Google Contacts.
Open the contatos_offline.html with you phone browser from a file explorer. The page will allow you to open a .CSV file on the phone, and that's it!
